üèè An SVM classifier that tells if a player is a better batter or a better bowler!


**Jack of All Trades, Master of One?**

This is an SVM Classifier that takes a cricketer's statistics, such as batting average and bowling economy, and classifies whether the cricketer is a better batsman or bowler. In other words, we will be able to tell which is a cricketer's primary skill - batting or bowling?

We can use it to determine at which skill are those rarebred all-rounders better at!

SVMs work well with small datasets and high dimensions, so they will be perfect for our cause. Credit to [Alice Zhao](https://github.com/adashofdata) for providing the inspiration needed for this mini-project.
